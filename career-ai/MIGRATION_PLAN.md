2. **Ikigai Store**
   - Conversation state and history
   - Extracted insights from conversation
   - Ikigai data (passion, strengths, domain)

3. **Project Store**
   - User projects
   - Selected project
   - Project suggestions
   - Progress tracking
   - Milestone management

#### UI Components

1. **Common Components**
   - Layout with navigation
   - Protected routes
   - Status badges
   - Modal dialogs

2. **Ikigai Components**
   - Conversational chat interface
   - Insights visualization
   - Domain selection cards

3. **Career Components**
   - Project cards
   - Progress tracking visualizations
   - Milestone management board
   - Delta4 analysis visualization
   - Company insights dashboard

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced User Experience

**Before (Streamlit):**
- Tab-based navigation requiring page refreshes
- Limited interactivity
- Basic UI components
- Linear user flows

**After (React):**
- Smooth client-side navigation
- Rich interactive components
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Intuitive user flows with better state persistence

### 2. Improved State Management

**Before (Streamlit):**
- Session state with limited reactivity
- State reset on page refreshes
- Manual state synchronization

**After (MobX):**
- Reactive state management
- Centralized stores with clear data flow
- Persistent state across navigation
- Optimized rendering with selective updates

### 3. Better Architecture

**Before (Streamlit):**
- Monolithic application structure
- Limited separation of concerns
- Tightly coupled UI and business logic

**After (React + FastAPI):**
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Modular component design
- RESTful API endpoints
- Better code organization and maintainability

### 4. Enhanced AI Integration
